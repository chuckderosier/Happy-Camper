The Happy Camper app is a way for a user to keep track of campsites they have visited so they can make future decisions about whether they want to visit there again or so they can make referrals to friends about those campsites.
The user will be able to view a list of all campsites they have visited and to click on the name of a specific campsite to see the details, including: name, location, description, rating, a link to the campsite reservation page, activities available, and a sample image of the campsite.
The user can add a new website and enter the details as listed above.
The user can change information about a website or even delete it.
